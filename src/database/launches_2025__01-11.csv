From 1985, these satellites will be gradually replaced by Strela-3, and then by Strela-3M from 2005. A civilian version of these satellites was created, called Goniets.Initially launched by six on Tsyklon, when the launcher was retired, they were only launched by two on Cosmos, before Rokot was put into service and allowed the sending of triplets of Strela satellites.",Low Earth Orbit,"Site 35/1, Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia",Success
